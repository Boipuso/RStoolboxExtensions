# RStoolboxExtensions

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

This package offers functions to automise pre-processing steps needed to conduct unsupervised
classifications with the "superSlass" function of the RStoolbox package. Additionally, post-processing functions to export landcover classes as (multi-)polygons and to mask, crop and export a raster to the respective landcover classes of the (multi-)polygons are included.

## Installation

You can install the development version of RStoolboxExtensions like so:

``` r
install_github("Boipuso/RStoolboxExtensions")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem. Let's say we want to conduct a 
supervised classification to map landcover change. The functions integrated in this package allow for fast pre-processing of the raster(s) and the training features. For this example we use the sample data of this package for the Sebangau Nationalpark in Borneo. 

```{r example}
## load the package
library(RStoolboxExtensions)

## retrieve the sample raster data from the package
 Sebangau15 <- system.file("extdata", "Sebangau15.tif", package = "RStoolboxExtensions")
 Sebangau15 <- rast_sample_read(Sebangau15)
 Sebangau23 <- system.file("extdata", "Sebangau23.tif", package = "RStoolboxExtensions")
 Sebangau23 <- rast_sample_read(Sebangau23)

 # read sample sf file of the RStoolboxExtensions package
 trainPoints <- system.file("extdata", "trainPoints.geojson", package = "RStoolboxExtensions")
 trainPoints <- sf_sample_read(trainPoints)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
